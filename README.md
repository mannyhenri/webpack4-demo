# Webpack 4 demo file
Keep this repo as an example for future non-react or non-angular client projects. Great starter with webpack. In this example (see the [webpack config file](./webpack.common.js)) we use...

1. Transpiling JS
2. CSS into the bundle
3. File loader for images
4. Code splitting/lazy-loading
5. HMR with webpack
6. Webpack config files for dev & prod (move specific rules to dev and prod)
7. Dist clean and HTML automatically generated with webpack
